# Monopoly
This project analyzes the evolution of Monopoly piecesâ€™ random positions using a Markov Chain model. By examining transitions between positions, it provides insights into their behavior and associated probabilities. Simulations reveal that some positions occur more frequently than others, offering insights into game strategies.

In this repository you can find four different files:
- m_public.mlx: this is the MATLAB live script file of the whole project;
- m_public.pdf: pdf version of m_public.pdf;
- n_turns.m and next_n_turns.m: These are two functions I developed for the analysis. Please refer to the files above for more details.

Hope you like it!
